// The ino code has been moved to a header file such that it 
// can be inspected in non-Arduino IDE environments with 
// proper code highlighting and intellisense too.

#include "Timer_ino.h"

// IMPORTANT: required for this example to work:
// if you are building from Arduino IDE, make sure to set 
// the build setting "Core Debug Level" to "info"
// and select baudrate=115200 in Serial Monitor.
