# If you like to use the CleanRTOS library as a component:
#
# 1. Copy CleanRTOS folder to the components folder
#    (if you included the Arduino IDE components, that folder should already
#     be present within the same folder as your "main" folder.)
# 2. Copy this CMakeLists file into the CleanRTOS folder.

# Edit following two lines to set component requirements (see docs)

# PS: it is also possible to install CleanRTOS as a normal, "non-component" library.
# In that case, don't use this CMakeLists file, but follow the instructions in the
# CMakeLists file in the "content for root folder" instead.
