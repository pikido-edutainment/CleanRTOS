// Demonstration of how to switch between building a program from 
// ESP_IDF and Arduino_IDE

// This main.cpp file wraps an Arduino IDE .ino file, such that it can be
// built by the ESP_IDF.

// Important: Update the CMakeLists file in the same folder as this main.cpp file
// (the folder "main", that is) to make sure that every dependency can be built. 
// For convenience, I have stored the CMakeLists file in the extra folder, such that
// it can be copied (from).

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <HelloWorld.ino>   // You can replace this with any example .ino that you'd like to build.

//------------------------------------
// Above, you can copy or include the contents of .ino examples from the arduino IDE.
// The only thing is: you may have to forward declare functions or change the order
// of functions, such that they're known before being called.
// (apparrently the esp IDF compiler is a bit less smart in that respect than the
// compiler used in the Arduino IDE)

extern "C" {
	void app_main();
}

void app_main(void)
{
	setup();
	for(;;)
	{
		loop();
		taskYIELD();  // prevent the watchdog timer to kick in for this thread.
	}
}
